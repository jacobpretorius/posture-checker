# posture-checker
Windows app to show a green bar across all screens every 20 minutes. I use the green bar as a reminder to sit with a little better posture.

## Usuage
- Run `PosChecker.exe`, preferrably automatically on boot by adding a shortcut to the .exe in your `shell:startup` folder.
- Click the green bar to hide it for 20 minutes.
